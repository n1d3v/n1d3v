# hello!!
i'm patricktbp, a 16 year old full-stack developer with a passion for old technology! here are some facts about myself and what i love
- i'm gay 🏳️‍🌈 and i am currently not single!! (haven't been since november)
- i currently use Windows 8.1 as my main computer operating system and my main phone is a Pixel 8
- i love music alot, if you look at my [last.fm](https://last.fm/user/patricktbp) profile you can clearly see so lol
- i love Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1, i think both were amazing and we take for granted the features that came out of it
- i love developing for older platforms like Windows Phone and bringing functionality to them
